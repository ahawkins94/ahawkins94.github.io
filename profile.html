                Gial Ackbar was a veteran male Mon Calamari soldier and revolutionary leader during the Clone Wars, the Galactic Civil War, and the conflict between the Resistance and the First Order. Throughout his sixty years of service, Ackbar was regarded as a brilliant tactician.

                <strong>Battle of Endor</strong>
                <br>
                Ackbar was one of the commanders of the Battle of Endor. By this time he was already an admiral in the Rebel fleet. At the pre-mission briefing, Gial told the plan of how the Rebels would attack the Death Star. He explained that a ground team led by General Han Solo would go to the surface of the forest moon of Endor and take out the shield generator, and that a fighter squadron led by Lando Calrissian would then enter the battle station's superstructure and take it out from the inside. He commanded the fleet from the bridge of his ship, Home One. Once the battle commenced, he noticed that the assault was a trap and that the Empire was leading them to their demise. Ackbar was reluctant to continue the battle after the Rebels saw that the Death Star's superlaser was operational. However, Lando Calrissian convinced him otherwise. Once Han Solo's squad took out the shield generator, Ackbar's fleet held off the rest of the Imperial forces while Lando Calrissian and his fighters, along with Wedge Antilles, flew inside the Death Star to take it out. Ackbar especially told his forces to concentrate their firepower on the Executor, which was ultimately destroyed.

                <strong>Showdown on Jakku</strong>
                <br>
              Following the events on Chandrila, Rax took control of the Imperial fleets and ordered them to assemble above the planet Jakku for a showdown with the New Republic. During the Battle of Jakku, Ackbar led the New Republic forces to victory over the Empire. Following the battle, the New Republic and Galactic Empire signed the Galactic Concordance which ended the Galactic Civil War. The Galactic Concordance demilitarized and imposed harsh sanctions on the remnants of the Empire. With the war's end, the New Republic turned its attention to restructuring the galactic order

                <strong>The Resistance</strong>
                <br>
                Twenty-three years later, Ackbar was coaxed out of his peaceful retirement by General Leia Organa to join the Resistance. At some point after his recruitment, Ackbar was captured by the First Order. Afraid that the First Order might execute him, the Resistance assembled a team led by Captain Hoff, with the sole purpose of locating Ackbar.The First Order knew the repercussions of allowing such a seasoned tactical powerhouse to command their enemy.
